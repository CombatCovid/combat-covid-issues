# Combat Covid
Combat Covid is a web application to help you discover, investigate, and obtain designs so that you can produce medical equipment to fit needs in your area, for dealing with the Covid virus.

Combat Covid is open source, and all its content is freely available to you, by the open source  licensing of the contributors who provide it.

## The Combat Covid Issues Repo
The repo you are looking at is the Combat Covid Issues Repo. 

As there are several facets to the project, this will give a central place to report problems, or identify needs, particularly with the web application itself.

Reporting as GitHub issues here will give the best opportunity for the team to see issues and respond, and we appreciate that you will use this.

If you know the problem is on a given Design Repo only, then you can report the issue there, finding it under this same CombatCovid organization.

The direct link for reporting issues with the web application that you are using  is: [Combat Covid App Issues](https://github.com/CombatCovid/combat-covid-issues/issues)

## What we can do

We try to be as effective as we can within the capability of our volunteer organization. 

Beyond having made this resource available, resources are quite limited, as there is much else to be done in building forwards from the present situation.

We appreciate your understanding, and know that this will guide your communications. Thank you.
