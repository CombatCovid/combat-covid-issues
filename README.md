# Combat Covid
Combat Covid is a web application to help you discover, investigate, and obtain designs so that you can produce medical equipment to fit needs in your area, for dealing with the Covid virus.

Combat Covid is open source, and its designs content is also freely available to you, by the open source licensing of the contributors who provide it.

## The Combat Covid Issues Repo
The repo you are looking at is the Combat Covid Issues Repo. 

As there are several facets to the project, this will give a central place to report problems, or identify needs.

Reporting as GitHub issues will give the best opportunity for the team to see needs and respond, and we appreciate that you will use this.

### How to report Design Repo issues

If you know the problem is on a given Design Repo only, then we encourage that you report the issue directly there, finding it on the list for the CombatCovid organization: [Combat Covid Design Repo Issues](https://github.com/CombatCovid)

### How to report Web App issues

The direct link for reporting problems with the web application that you are using is: [Combat Covid Web App Issues](https://github.com/CombatCovid/combat-covid-issues/issues).

## What we can do

We try to be as effective as we can within the capability of our volunteer organization. 

Beyond having made the CombatCovid content present and searchable on the web, resources are quite limited, as there is much else to be done in building forwards from the present situation.

We appreciate your understanding, and know that this will guide your communications. Thank you.
